# 🏠 House Price Predictor (Flask Web App)

This project is an end-to-end **Machine Learning web application** that predicts **California house prices** based on various housing features.  
The ML model is trained using **Scikit-learn** and deployed using **Flask**.

---

## Features
- Predicts house prices using a trained **Random Forest Regressor**
- Handles missing values, scaling, and categorical encoding using a **Pipeline**
- Web interface built with **Flask**
- Clean separation of training, preprocessing, and inference
- Ready for deployment

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. Load housing dataset
2. Perform stratified train-test split
3. Handle missing values 
4. Scale numerical features
5. Encode categorical features using OneHotEncoder
6. Train RandomForestRegressor
7. Save model and preprocessing pipeline using Joblib
8. Serve predictions using Flask
